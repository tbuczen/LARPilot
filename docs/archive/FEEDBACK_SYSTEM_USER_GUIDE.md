## Tips for Effective Feedback

### For Bug Reports

**Good Example:**
```
Subject: Character skills not displaying on mobile

Description:
When viewing my character sheet on mobile (iPhone 13, Safari),
the skills section shows as blank. This happens consistently
even after refreshing.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open any character sheet
2. Scroll to skills section
3. Skills list is empty (but shows correctly on desktop)

Expected: Skills should display on mobile like on desktop
Actual: Skills section is blank
```

**Include:**
- ‚úÖ Clear description of what's wrong
- ‚úÖ Steps to reproduce the issue
- ‚úÖ Expected vs. actual behavior
- ‚úÖ Screenshot showing the problem

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Vague descriptions: "It's broken"
- ‚ùå Missing context: "Doesn't work"

### For Feature Requests

**Good Example:**
```
Subject: Add bulk import for character backgrounds

Description:
I'm running a LARP with 50+ players. Currently I have to copy/paste
each character's background individually from our Google Doc.

Suggested feature:
- Add a "Bulk Import" button on the characters list
- Accept CSV or paste from spreadsheet
- Map columns to character fields
- Preview before import

This would save hours of manual data entry when setting up a new LARP.
```

**Include:**
- ‚úÖ Your use case / problem
- ‚úÖ How the feature would help
- ‚úÖ Suggested implementation (optional)

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Just "Add feature X" without context
- ‚ùå Features that already exist (check docs first)

### For Questions

**Good Example:**
```
Subject: How do I assign quests to multiple characters?

Description:
I have a quest that involves 5 different characters. I can only
see how to assign it to one character at a time on the quest
edit form. Is there a way to multi-select characters, or do I
need to create separate quest instances?

I'm on the quest edit page: /backoffice/larp/42/quests/edit/123
```

**Include:**
- ‚úÖ Specific question
- ‚úÖ What you've tried
- ‚úÖ Where you're stuck

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Multiple unrelated questions in one submission
- ‚ùå Questions answered in documentation (check docs first)

## Examples Gallery

### Example 1: Bug Report with Screenshot

![Bug Report Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/dc3545/ffffff?text=Bug+Report+Example)

**Type:** üêõ Bug Report
**Subject:** Navigation menu overlaps content on tablet
**Description:**
```
On iPad (Safari), the navigation menu overlaps the main content area
when viewing the character list. The menu appears to be positioned
incorrectly at screen widths between 768px-1024px.

Screenshot shows the overlap clearly - you can see the character
cards partially hidden behind the menu.
```

### Example 2: Feature Request

![Feature Request Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/0d6efd/ffffff?text=Feature+Request+Example)

**Type:** üí° Feature Request
**Subject:** Export LARP schedule to Google Calendar
**Description:**
```
As a LARP organizer, I'd like to export our event schedule to Google
Calendar so participants can automatically sync events to their personal
calendars.

Suggested workflow:
1. On the Event Planning calendar page, add "Export" button
2. Generate an .ics file with all scheduled events
3. Include event details, location, and participant assignments

This would reduce scheduling conflicts and improve participant attendance.
```

### Example 3: Question

![Question Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/ffc107/000000?text=Question+Example)

**Type:** ‚ùì Question
**Subject:** How do I link characters to quests?
**Description:**
```
I'm setting up quests for my LARP and want to link specific characters
to each quest. I see the quest edit form but can't find where to assign
characters.

What I've tried:
- Checked the quest edit page - no character field visible
- Looked in character edit page - no quest assignment section
- Searched documentation for "quest character link"

Am I missing something obvious, or is this done differently?
```

### Example 4: General Feedback

![General Feedback Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/28a745/ffffff?text=General+Feedback+Example)

**Type:** üí¨ General Feedback
**Subject:** Love the new story graph feature!
**Description:**
```
Just wanted to say the story graph visualization is amazing! Being able
to see all the character connections and plot threads visually makes it
so much easier to manage complex LARP narratives.

Small suggestion: It would be great to filter the graph by character
type (PC vs NPC) to reduce clutter when needed.

Keep up the excellent work!
```
